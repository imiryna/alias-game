# 🧩 Alias-Game Backend

### 📄 Overview  
**Alias-Game Backend** is a **Node.js + Express + Socket.IO** server for a multiplayer word-guessing game inspired by *Alias*.  
It handles **user authentication**, **game logic**, **team and chat management**, and **real-time gameplay synchronization**.

## Socket.IO Integration

This project uses **Socket.IO** with an **Express** and **MongoDB** backend to enable real-time communication between users.

- Socket.IO runs on the **same port** as Express (`http://localhost:3000`).

- Always perform user authentication before creating the Socket.IO connection on the client side, to ensure only authorized users can connect and join rooms.

## Overview

- **Express** handles REST API routes (e.g., `/messages`, `/teams/:id`).
- **Socket.IO** manages real-time events like new messages, user connections, and online status.
- **MongoDB** stores chats and messages persistently.

## How It Works

1. When a user connects, the server assigns a unique `socket.id`.
2. Each team has its own **room** identified by `teamId`.
3. Users join their team room via:

   ```js
   socket.emit("joinTeam", { userId, teamId });
   ```

4. Messages are sent in real time:

   ```js
   socket.emit("sendMessage", { teamId, userId, text });
   ```

5. The server saves messages to MongoDB and broadcasts them:

   ```js
   io.to(teamId).emit("newMessage", message);
   ```

## 🔌 Socket.IO Events

| Event           | Direction       | Description                                    |
|-----------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `joinTeam`      | client → server | Join a specific team room                      |
| `chatHistory`   | server → client | Send previous messages                         |
| `sendMessage`   | client → server | Send a new message                             |
| `newMessage`    | server → client | Broadcast message to all team members          |
| `userJoined`    | server → client | Notify that a user joined the team             |
| `userOffline`   | server → client | Notify that a user left the game               |
| `systemMessage` | server → client | System messages (round end, timer alerts, etc) |

## 🧠 Developer Notes

- All async routes are wrapped in `catchAsync`.
- JWT-based authentication with middleware `protected`.
- MongoDB connection initialized via `server.js`.
- Socket.io events are managed in `socketManager.js`.
- Game automatically ends after **10 rounds**, but can also be ended manually with `/api/game/:id/end`.

## 🐳 Docker Setup & Commands

This project includes a Dockerfile and a docker-compose.yml to simplify local development and deployment.
Three services are defined in docker-compose.yml:

Service	Description	Port
app	Node.js backend (Alias Game API)	3000
mongo	MongoDB database	27017
mongo-express	Web UI for MongoDB	8081

All environment variables are managed via .env.

Create and run containers with docker (MongoDB + App):

```
docker-compose up --build

## ❓ FAQ

**1. How does the game start?**  
After creating a game and teams, call `/api/game/startgame`. This initializes the first round and activates the explainer rotation.

**2. How do players join a team?**  
Use `POST /api/logic/:teamId/join`. Once joined, the player is connected to the team room (Socket.IO handles this automatically).

**3. What happens when a player leaves a team?**  
Use `POST /api/logic/:teamId/leave`. The server removes the player from that team and broadcasts a `userOffline` event.

**4. How do rounds work?**  
Each round lasts for a fixed time (e.g. 60 seconds). When time is up, the server emits a `systemMessage` about the round ending, and the next team/explainer is activated.

**5. How is the explainer chosen?**  
Explainers rotate automatically within a team — for each round, the next player becomes the explainer. This ensures balanced participation.

**6. Can I simulate a full game manually (via Postman)?**  
Yes:  
1️⃣ Create a game → `POST /api/game`  
2️⃣ Create two teams → `POST /api/team`  
3️⃣ Join players to each team → `POST /api/logic/:teamId/join`  
4️⃣ Start the game → `POST /api/game/startgame`  
5️⃣ Send messages during rounds via Socket event `sendMessage`  
6️⃣ End the game manually → `POST /api/game/:id/end`  

**7. Does the game end automatically?**  
Yes — after **10 rounds**, the game automatically ends. You can also trigger `/api/game/:id/end` to stop it early.

**8. How is scoring handled?**  
Each correct guess adds a point to the team’s score. Points are stored in the Team model and updated at the end of every round.

**9. What happens if the server restarts during the game?**  
Active games and team states are stored in MongoDB, so they can be restored when the server comes back online.

**10. Is chat history persistent?**  
Yes — all messages are saved in the `Chat` collection with timestamps and team references.

**11. How to test Socket.IO locally?**  
You can connect via the Socket.IO client or use Postman’s WebSocket feature.  
Example:
```
ws://localhost:3000
```
Then emit `joinTeam` and `sendMessage` events.

**12. How to handle JWT expiration?**  
Use `/api/auth/refresh` to obtain a new access token when the old one expires.

**13. Are all endpoints protected?**  
Only key routes (like `/send`, `/next-round`, `/join`, `/leave`) are protected via `protected` middleware. Public endpoints include `/signup`, `/login`, `/help`.

**14. How are errors returned?**  
All errors are unified:
```json
{
  "message": "Team not found"
}
```

**15. Can multiple games run simultaneously?**  
Yes, each game instance is isolated by its ID and has its own set of teams and chat rooms.
