#  Alias-Game Backend

###  Overview  
**Alias-Game Backend** is a **Node.js + Express + Socket.IO** server for a multiplayer word-guessing game inspired by *Alias*.  
It handles **user authentication**, **game logic**, **team and chat management**, and **real-time gameplay synchronization**.  
The backend uses **MongoDB** for persistent data storage and **Socket.IO** for real-time communication between players.

## Socket.IO Integration

This project uses **Socket.IO** with an **Express** and **MongoDB** backend to enable real-time communication between users.

- Socket.IO runs on the **same port** as Express (`http://localhost:3000`).

- Always perform user authentication before creating the Socket.IO connection on the client side, to ensure only authorized users can connect and join rooms.

## Overview

- **Express** handles REST API routes (e.g., `/messages`, `/teams/:id`).
- **Socket.IO** manages real-time events like new messages, user connections, and online status.
- **MongoDB** stores chats and messages persistently.

## How It Works

1. When a user connects, the server assigns a unique `socket.id`.
2. Each team has its own **room** identified by `teamId`.
3. Users join their team room via:

   ```js
   socket.emit("joinTeam", { userId, teamId });
   ```

4. Messages are sent in real time:

   ```js
   socket.emit("sendMessage", { teamId, userId, text });
   ```

5. The server saves messages to MongoDB and broadcasts them:

   ```js
   io.to(teamId).emit("newMessage", message);
   ```

## Socket.IO Events

| Event           | Direction       | Description                                    |
|-----------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `joinTeam`      | client → server | Join a specific team room                      |
| `chatHistory`   | server → client | Send previous messages                         |
| `sendMessage`   | client → server | Send a new message                             |
| `newMessage`    | server → client | Broadcast message to all team members          |
| `userJoined`    | server → client | Notify that a user joined the team             |
| `userOffline`   | server → client | Notify that a user left the game               |
| `systemMessage` | server → client | System messages (round end, timer alerts, etc) |

---

## Developer Notes

- All async routes are wrapped in `catchAsync`.
- JWT-based authentication with middleware `protected`.
- MongoDB connection initialized via `server.js`.
- Socket.io events are managed in `socketManager.js`.
- Game automatically ends after **10 rounds**, but can also be ended manually with `/api/game/:id/end`.

## Node EventEmitter Events

| Event Name         | Direction        | Description                                                                  |
|--------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `updateTeam`       | internal event   | Updates a team document in the database with provided fields.                |
| `userUpdate`       | internal event   | Updates a user document in the database with new values.                     |
| `io:connect`       | system event     | Fired when a user connects — stores the user’s socket ID in `onlineUsers`.   |
| `io:disconnect`    | system event     | Fired when a user disconnects — removes them from `onlineUsers` map.         |
| `chat:preCheck`    | internal event   | Runs pre-check logic on a new chat message before broadcasting.              |
| `chat:newMessage`  | emitted event    | Emitted after message validation — triggers sending the processed message.   |


## Notes

- All these events are managed inside **`gameEmitter`**, defined in `events/gameEmitter.js` (or similar file in your project).  
- `gameEmitter` acts as a **singleton**, coordinating internal state updates and communication between different modules (teams, users, chat, sockets).  
- These events are used **server-side only**, not visible to frontend clients.  
- Socket.IO events are built **on top** of these internal events to synchronize updates with connected clients.

## FAQ

**1. How does the game start?**  
After creating a game (POST /api/game) and teams (POST /api/team), call POST /api/game/startgame.
This initializes the first round, creates team chats (via /api/chat/:teamId), and activates the explainer rotation for each team.

**2. How do players join a team?**  
Use POST /api/team/:teamId/join.
The server validates the teamId, adds the player to that team, and connects them to the team’s room in Socket.IO.
All team members receive a real-time update when someone joins.

**3. What happens when a player leaves a team?**  
When a player leaves a team using POST /api/logic/:teamId/leave,
the backend removes the player from that team and emits a playerLeft event (via the internal gameEmitter) to update the game state for other teammates.

**4. How do rounds work?**  
Each round lasts for a fixed time (e.g. 60 seconds).
When the timer ends, the server emits a systemMessage that includes:
- The end of the current round,
- The next team and explainer who will play,
- The guessed word or current game status.
After that, the next round automatically starts with the new explainer and word.

**5. How is the explainer chosen?**  
Explainers rotate automatically within a team — for each round, the next player becomes the explainer. This ensures balanced participation.

**6. Can I simulate a full game manually (via Postman)?**  
Yes. Here’s the sequence:
- 1️⃣ Create a game → POST /api/game
- 2️⃣ Create two teams → POST /api/team (or via setup logic)
- 3️⃣ Join players to each team → POST /api/team/:teamId/join
- 4️⃣ Start the game → POST /api/game/startgame
- 5️⃣ Send messages (round activity) → Socket event sendMessage or POST /api/chat/send

**7. Does the game end automatically?**  
Yes — after 10 rounds, the game stops automatically.

**8. How is scoring handled?**  
Each correct guess adds a point to the team’s score. Points are stored in the Team model and updated at the end of every round.

**9. What happens if the server restarts during the game?**  
Active games and team states are stored in MongoDB, so they can be restored when the server comes back online.

**10. Is chat history persistent?**  
Yes — all messages are saved in the `Chat` collection with timestamps and team references.

**11. How to test Socket.IO locally?**  
You can connect via the Socket.IO client or use Postman’s WebSocket feature.
Alternatively, you can run the example client — aliasClient_v2.js located in the /examples directory — to test game events and socket interactions locally. 

Example:
```
ws://localhost:3000
```
Then emit `joinTeam` and `sendMessage` events.

**12. How to handle JWT expiration?**  
When your access token expires, request a new one via:
POST /api/auth/refresh
You must include your refresh token in the request body or header, depending on implementation.

**13. Are all endpoints protected?**  
Not all — only the key routes require authentication middleware:
Protected: /api/game, /api/team, /api/user, /api/chat, /api/auth/refresh
Public: /api/auth/signup, /api/auth/login, /help
Authentication is handled via the custom protected middleware that verifies JWT.

**14. How are errors returned?**  
All errors are unified:
```json
{
  "message": "Team not found"
}
```

**15. How are chats handled for each team?**
Each team has its own chat:
- GET /api/chat/:teamId → get message history
- POST /api/chat/:teamId → create a new chat for the team
- POST /api/chat/send → send a message (Socket.IO event is also emitted)
All chat routes are protected and available only to authenticated users.

**16. Can multiple games run simultaneously?**  
Yes, each game instance is isolated by its ID and has its own set of teams and chat rooms.
